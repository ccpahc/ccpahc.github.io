Welcome to the home for **Toward a new CCP for Arts, Humanities, and Culture research (CCP-AHC)**, a UKRI-funded scoping project. The main objective of CCP-AHC is to collaboratively produce a multi-year roadmap for a new Collaborative Computational Project (CCP) serving Arts, Humanities, and Culture researchers. The draft roadmap will be published by the end of 2025, and the final roadmap will be published by the end of 2026.

## Open calls

[Tell us about your your software!](./activities/codes-eoi.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary } 

We invite owners, maintainers, users, and other stakeholders in research codes, workflows, and pipelines that support computationally-intensive arts, humanities, and culture (AH&C) research and innovation [to submit a short expression of interest form](https://forms.office.com/e/EAyaK8cajv). 

The expression of interest is a short case for the relevance of that code to CCP-AHC.

## Upcoming events

CCP-AHC will hold a Town Hall meeting on Thursday, 22 May 2025 in Durham (UK). [Learn more about this event](./activities/town-hall-2025/index.md). 

## Details

CCP-AHC is the name for a two-year scoping and community-building exercise, funded by UKRI and STFC for 24 months from January 2025. Its goal is to support the sustainable and efficient development of software, pipelines, and workflows used by arts, humanities, and culture researchers who make use of UK-based digital research infrastructure (DRI). It will do so by disseminating and implementing the Collaborative Computational Project (CCP) model that has been successfully been used by [many other scientific software communities](https://www.ccp.ac.uk/about-ccps/) over the past several decades.

There is a special emphasis on ensuring that research software developed by this community makes the best of use of DRI supported by public funding. This includes existing and future high-performance computing (HPC) and advanced computing infrastructures supported by UKRI, as well as those run by UK-based HEIs and [other research organisations eligible for UKRI funding](https://www.ukri.org/publications/organisation-eligibility/research-organisations-eligible-for-ukri-funding/). The full title of the project is “Toward a new CCP for Arts, Humanities, and Culture research (CCP-AHC)”.
