Welcome to the home for **Toward a new CCP for Arts, Humanities, and Culture research (CCP-AHC)**, a UKRI-funded scoping project. The main objective of CCP-AHC is to collaboratively produce a multi-year roadmap for a new Collaborative Computational Project (CCP) serving Arts, Humanities, and Culture researchers. The draft roadmap will be published by the end of 2025, and the final roadmap will be published by the end of 2026.

## Events

### Upcoming

CCP-AHC will hold four [regional engagement events](./activities/regional-engagement.md) in the coming months. The following events are confirmed and **registration is open**:

- [CCP-AHC Engagement Event (Cardiff)](./activities/regional-engagement.md#ccp-ahc-regional-workshop-cardiff-wednesday-29th-october-2025) on Wednesday, 29th October 2025, 12.30pm to 3.30pm at Wales Millenium Centre, Cardiff
- [CCP-AHC Engagement Event (Edinburgh)](./activities/regional-engagement.md#ccp-ahc-regional-workshop-edinburgh-thursday-6th-november-2025) on Thursday, 6th November 2025, 1pm to 5 pm at University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh
- [CCP-AHC Engagement Event (London)](./activities/regional-engagement.md#ccp-ahc-regional-workshop-london-friday-14th-november-2025) on Friday, 14th November 2025, 12.30pm to 4pm, Central London

### Past

CCP-AHC held a Town Hall meeting on Thursday, 22 May 2025 in Durham (UK). [Learn more about this event](./activities/town-hall-2025/index.md). 

## Community meetings

The [CCP-AHC Community Forum](./activities/community-forum.md) takes place online on the second Tuesday of each month, 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. (UK time) starting from Tuesday, 12 August 2025.  

These are informal, drop-in sessions open to all. Join these meetings to learn more about the project, to hear updates from the team, and to share your experiences accessing large-scale compute for arts, humanities, and culture research. [Sign up to recieve the meeting details](https://forms.office.com/e/BnW8PZwJA9).

## Open calls

[Tell us about your software!](./activities/codes-eoi.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary } 

We invite owners, maintainers, users, and other stakeholders in research codes, workflows, and pipelines that support computationally-intensive arts, humanities, and culture (AH&C) research and innovation [to submit a short expression of interest form](https://forms.office.com/e/EAyaK8cajv). 

The expression of interest is a short case for the relevance of that code to CCP-AHC.

## Details

CCP-AHC is the name for a two-year scoping and community-building exercise, funded by UKRI and STFC for 24 months from January 2025. Its goal is to support the sustainable and efficient development of software, pipelines, and workflows used by arts, humanities, and culture researchers who make use of UK-based digital research infrastructure (DRI). It will do so by disseminating and implementing the Collaborative Computational Project (CCP) model that has been successfully been used by [many other scientific software communities](https://www.ccp.ac.uk/about-ccps/) over the past several decades.

There is a special emphasis on ensuring that research software developed by this community makes the best of use of DRI supported by public funding. This includes existing and future high-performance computing (HPC) and advanced computing infrastructures supported by UKRI, as well as those run by UK-based HEIs and [other research organisations eligible for UKRI funding](https://www.ukri.org/publications/organisation-eligibility/research-organisations-eligible-for-ukri-funding/). The full title of the project is “Toward a new CCP for Arts, Humanities, and Culture research (CCP-AHC)”.
