Welcome to the home for **Toward a new CCP for Arts, Humanities, and Culture research (CCP-AHC)**, a UKRI-funded scoping project. The main objective of CCP-AHC is to collaboratively produce a multi-year roadmap for a new Computational Collaborative Project (CCP) serving Arts, Humanities, and Culture researchers. The draft roadmap will be published by the end of 2025, and the final roadmap will be published by the end of 2026.

## Details

CCP-AHC is the name for a two-year scoping and community-building exercise, funded by UKRI and STFC for 24 months from January 2025. Its goal is to support the sustainable and efficient development of software, pipelines, and workflows used by arts, humanities, and culture researchers who make use of UK-based digital research infrastructure (DRI). It will do so by disseminating the Collaborative Computational Project (CCP) model that has been successfully been used by [many other scientific software communities](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/CoSeC_communities_supported.aspx) over the past five decades.

There is a special emphasis on ensuring that research software developed by this community makes the best of use of DRI supported by public funding. This includes existing and future high-performance computing (HPC) and advanced computing infrastructures supported by UKRI, as well as those run by UK-based HEIs and [other research organsiations eligible for UKRI funding](https://www.ukri.org/publications/organisation-eligibility/research-organisations-eligible-for-ukri-funding/). The full title of the project is “Toward a new CCP for Arts, Humanities, and Culture research (CCP-AHC)”.
