This is an incomplete list of links to public user documentation pages for a number of HPC sites, including many UK-based [Tier 3](https://docs.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/intro/#hpc-tiers) systems. If you would like to propose changes to this list, please [open a pull request](https://github.com/ccpahc/ccpahc.github.io/edit/main/docs/resources/sites.md) or [contact the project team](../index.md#contact).

The motivations behind making this information available in one place are as follows:

- Access to HPC by "non-traditional" users, such as those in the arts, humanities, and culture (AH&C) area starts with interactions with local sites, which are getting harder to discover thanks to the growth of university intranets;
- Often, the user documentation implicitly or explicitly describes software that is commonly used at that site, alongside useful insights gained from supporting that software;
- To facilitate detecting trends in the provision of user-facing documentation, such as the prevalence (at the time of writing) of MkDocs as a static site generator.
