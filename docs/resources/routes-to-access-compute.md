There are a number of routes to access national compute infrastructures relevant to CCP-AHC members. 

Please contact <ccpahc@durham.ac.uk> if you are interested in receiving support when preparing a submission to one of these calls.

In some cases, it will benefit your case to recieve access if you have already explored whether your application can make use of [regional or institutional compute](./sites.md).

## AI Research Resource (AIRR) Gateway route

Designed for researchers from academia, industry, or other UK organisations, this route supports: first-time users of AI supercomputing resources; testing of (novel) algorithms, code, and workflows; benchmarking of algorithms, code, and workflows before applying for larger AIRR opportunities.

For more details, please read [the guidance available online](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-research-resource/airr-gateway-route-ukri-guidance).

## UKRI Access to high performance computing facilities 

This opportunity provides an open and flexible route to computational support for high quality projects across the entire UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) remit. Applications that: involve early career researchers; onboard and train new users; significantly push the boundaries in computational research using high performance computing (HPC) in your field are encouraged. 

This application process is purely for compute resource for up to 12 months. No funding is available to successful applicants.

You must be based at a UK research organisation eligible for UKRI funding.

For more details, please read [the guidance available online](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/access-to-high-performance-computing-facilities-spring-2025/) for a previous iteration of the call. These calls are typically open twice a year.
