    We provide a brief guide to some of the most important routes to access compute that UK-based AHC researchers and innovators can use **today**.

## Calculators

Calculators can help you estimate the compute and data resources you need before choosing a solution. 

In the end, their outputs are based on assumptions which may or may not hold in your software. Often, the only way to accurately measure the resource you need is to run an experiment, but calculators can help you rapidly estimate the properties of different hypothetical configurations before you take this step.
