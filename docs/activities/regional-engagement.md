CCP-AHC will hold four regional engagement events in the coming months. 

These events are an opportunity to learn more about the community and to shape the future of CCP-AHC, by contributing to the [open draft of the CCP-AHC roadmap](https://zenodo.org/records/17099176). This document builds on the outcomes of the CCP-AHC Town Hall 2025 and the monthly CCP-AHC Community Forum meetings and will inform our reporting to STFC and the design of the CCP in the future.

The following events are confirmed. Please register for the event that is most convenient/accessible for you.
