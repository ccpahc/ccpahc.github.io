# CCP-AHC Call for Research Software

This form allows prospective community members to bring a research software project to the attention of the CCP-AHC team. We invite owners, maintainers, users, funders and other stakeholders in research codes, workflows, and pipelines that support arts, humanities, and culture (AH&C) research and innovation activities to submit.

[Submit research software](https://forms.office.com/e/EAyaK8cajv){ .md-button .md-button--primary } 

The submission is a short case for the relevance of that code to CCP-AHC.

## Scope

We are particularly interested in projects that have the potential for development by engagement with RSE resource within CCP-AHC and CoSeC both during the scoping project and over the longer-term future of this project and related initiatives. 

We are also interested in software that is running or has the potential to run on UK-funded HPC and advanced computing resource, including accelerated computing supported by e.g. GPUs and other novel accelerators. 

Software developed primarily outside of the UK may be in scope if there are UK-based AH&C users and/or contributors.

## Notes

Submission at this stage does not constitute a bid for support from CCP-AHC and does not preclude codes from receiving or seeking support at a future stage. Our aim is to discover codes and their stakeholders, and to iteratively refine the codes discovery process, which will also be supported by desk research over the next 12 months.

The expression of interest process itself, including its scope and priorities, is also subject to change in response to community needs, so please share feedback with [the project team](../index.md#delivery-team).
