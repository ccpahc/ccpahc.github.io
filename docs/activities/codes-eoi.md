# CCP-AHC Expression of Interest for Research Software

We have also made available a brief expression of interest form available, allowing prospective community members to bring a code or codes to the attention of the CCP-AHC team. We invite owners, maintainers, users, and other stakeholders in research codes, workflows, and pipelines that support arts, humanities, and culture (AH&C) research and innovation activities [to submit a short expression of interest form](https://forms.office.com/e/EAyaK8cajv). 

[Expression of Interest for Research Software](https://forms.office.com/e/EAyaK8cajv){ .md-button .md-button--primary } 

The expression of interest is a short case for the relevance of that code to CCP-AHC.

## Scope

We are particularly interested in projects that have the potential for development by engagement with RSE resource within CCP-AHC and CoSeC both during the scoping project and over the longer-term future of this project and related initiatives. 

We are also interested in software that is running or has the potential to run on UK-funded HPC and advanced computing resource, including accelerated computing supported by e.g. GPUs and other novel accelerators. 

## Notes

Submission of an expression of interest at this stage does not constitute a bid for support from CCP-AHC and does not preclude codes from receiving or seeking support at a future stage. Our aim is to discover codes and their stakeholders, and to iteratively refine the codes discovery process, which will also be supported by desk research over the next 12 months.

The expression of interest process itself, including its scope and priorities, is also subject to change in response to community needs, so please share feedback with [the project team](../index.md#delivery-team).
