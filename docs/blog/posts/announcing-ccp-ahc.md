# Introducing CCP-AHC

We are pleased to introduce **Toward a new CCP for Arts, Humanities, and Culture research (CCP-AHC)**, a UKRI-funded scoping project, which begins on 1 January 2025 and runs for 24 months. The main objective of CCP-AHC is to collaboratively produce a multi-year roadmap for a new Computational Collaborative Project (CCP) serving Arts, Humanities, and Culture researchers. The draft roadmap will be published by the end of 2025, and the final roadmap will be published by the end of 2026.

The project will be delivered by [a team of researchers](../../index.md#delivery-team) at Durham University, University of Brighton, and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).
