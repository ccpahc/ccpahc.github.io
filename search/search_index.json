Its goal is to support the sustainable and efficient development of software, pipelines, and workflows used by arts, humanities, and culture researchers who make use of UK-based digital research infrastructure (DRI). It will do so by disseminating the Collaborative Computational Project (CCP) model that has been successfully been used by many other scientific software communities over the past five decades.</p> <p>There is a special emphasis on ensuring that research software developed by this community makes the best of use of DRI supported by public funding. This includes existing and future high-performance computing (HPC) and advanced computing infrastructures supported by UKRI, as well as those run by UK-based HEIs and other research organsiations eligible for UKRI funding.

No single infrastructure has grown up in its absence; instead, computationally intensive research by AH&amp;C researchers has been conducted in relative isolation. Although the promises of \u201cbig data,\u201d e-Science, and grid computing have been recognised in turn by this community, only relatively few researchers have successfully redeemed them in shared-compute infrastructure in the last ten years (Bower et al. 2014,\u00a0Terras et al. 2018,\u00a0Ruan et al. 2018). The community now sees the value in the application of machine learning (ML) and AI. But the picture around HPC usage to support the computationally and energy-efficient large-scale use of these techniques is incomplete. Previous efforts to gather community requirements targeting AHRC-facing researchers provide some insights into HPC and cloud computing usage, where 38% of survey respondents used or were moving to \u201cHPC/Cloud\u201d in 2021 (Sufi et al. 2023). The culture within the community around research outputs, skills, and institutional support were viewed as other barriers to adoption (Barker et al. 2024).</p> <p>Notwithstanding this, flagship UKRI AHRC DRI investments are increasingly interested in leveraging ML and AI methods on the data they produce or steward. Widening access to DRI is a funder priority (e.g.\u00a0AHRC Strategic Delivery Plan 2022-2025) and recent North American delivery models provide inspiration for how this can be achieved (Dombrowski et al. 2024). The trend in other disciplines toward exposing workflows via well-maintained, usable, interactive applications (e.g.\u00a0Galaxy,\u00a0SBGrid) is also welcomed. However, more work is required to ensure that codes/toolchains and infrastructure are accessible and usable (Zundert 2012). Except for a few mature projects (e.g. the\u00a0GATE NLP solution), AH&amp;C-domain-specific codes/toolchains have a short lifespan, do not easily extend beyond the research context that produces them, tend to be written by autodidacts, and exceptionally make use of shared-compute infrastructures. They may be developed internationally and may either originate or have strong dependencies on codes and libraries developed in the commercial sector, posing further challenges to their scalability and sustainability. Sustainability also depends on a highly skilled technical workforce. This demand will grow as more research projects engage with the development of RTP career paths (e.g.\u00a0Digital Humanities &amp; Research Software Engineering Summer School).</p> <p>Fortunately, sustainability and openness are generally welcomed in the community we target: finding ways to incentivise and implement permissive licensing, FAIR infrastructure, and other Open Science/Research principles are important to AH&amp;C researchers (Arthur and Hearn 2021). Examples of these are the availability of AI-centric software outputs using open-source licences (e.g.\u00a0AH/Y00745X/1), and novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorial publications (e.g.\u00a0The Programming Historian) that support AH&amp;C researchers to learn digital tools and techniques. In addition, European infrastructures (e.g. the CLARIN and DARIAH ERICs) and UK DRI actions, such as the scoping projects for future data services and repositories (e.g.\u00a0AH/W007541/1,\u00a0AH/W007592/1,\u00a0AH/W007533/1), have increased the discoverability of codes, data infrastructures, and workflows---and the training required to make use of them.</p> <p>CCP-AHC will build on some of these outcomes and networks to widen participation in HPC, and - against the background of the convergence between AI and HPC - ultimately increase the uptake of large-scale AI by AH&amp;C communities. We look to efforts from computationally intensive fields beyond the physical sciences, such as bioinformatics, which continue to support skills development (Zhan et al. 2019) and HPC use (Castrignan\u00f2 et al. 2020). The US Department of Energy have shown how HPC skills infrastructure can tie workforce development initiatives to broader concerns, including widening participation in science, inclusive instructional design, and environmental sustainability (McInnes et al. 2023). Relatedly, the concurrent funding of the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)\u00a0led by AHRC\u00a0(until 2028) and\u00a0the BRAID programme\u00a0(2022-2028) represents a compelling development: the flow of expertise from AHRC-facing researchers into computational sciences in the UK.</p>"},{"location":"activities/","title":"Activities","text":"<p>During the first two years, CCP-AHC will:</p> <ul> <li>discover and co-ordinate stakeholders and their corresponding research software projects via online communications, community meetups, and a new CCP-AHC mailing list;</li> <li>host two Town Hall meetings in Summer 2025 and Summer 2026;</li> <li>carry out at least four regional engagement meetings in each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on themes;</li> <li>offer free code review sessions to selected software projects;</li> <li>iteratively develop a five-year roadmap for the community, based on the outcomes of the engagement activities, with national and international strategy and policy in mind;</li> <li>co-ordinate a bid to establish a new CCP for up to five years, which is expected to be submitted in 2027.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"activities/town-hall-2025/","title":"Town Hall 2025","text":"<p>CCP-AHC will hold a Town Hall meeting in Summer 2025, at a time and location to be confirmed.
